\section{Introduction}
Pumping Lemma describes an essential characteristic of regular languages. It says that a string with sufficiently long length belonging to a regular language can be divided into three sections, then the string obtained by pumping(or repeating) the middle section also belongs to the same language.

\begin{center}

        Pumping Lemma states that for given a regular language $L$, there exists an integer $p\ge 1$ such that every string $w$ having $\mid w \mid \ge p$ can be expressed as $w=xyz$ and the following conditions hold:\\
        $$\mid y\mid \ge 1$$ 
        $$\mid xy\mid \le p$$
        $$(\forall n\ge 0) (xy^nz\in L) $$
        Mathematically,
        $$
        \forall L \subseteq \Sigma^*, \text{ regular}(L) 
        $$
        $$
        \implies  \exists p \geq 1, \forall w \in L, \mid w\mid  \geq p 
        $$
        $$
        \implies  \exists x, y, z \in \Sigma^*, (w = xyz) \land (\mid y\mid  \geq 1) \land (\mid xy\mid  \leq p) \land (\forall n \geq 0, xy^n z \in L)
        $$
    }
}
\end{center}

We can get intuitions behind this lemma by considering a DFA that accepts a regular language $L$ (as the language is regular we can construct a DFA), let $w$ be a string in $L$ having length at least $p$ say $n$. Let $A$,$B$ and $C$ be some of the states through which $w$ goes through. As $w$ is in the language, it will be accepted by DFA so C is a final state. As each character corresponds to a transition, the number of characters is equal to the number of transitions, hence there are $n$ transitions so $n+1$ states from initial to the final state. As $n\ge p\implies n+1>p$, hence according to pigeonhole principle there is a repetition of one state and say it is $B$. 

We can divide the string $w$ into $x,y,z$; $x$ being the part before reaching $B$, $y$ being the part between two occurrences of $B$ and $z$ being the part after B.

We can now check the conditions given in the lemma, $\mid y\mid\ge 1$ as that is the part that occurs between two repetition of $B$, $\mid xy\mid \le p$ as a repetition occurs in $p+1$ states and third condition holds as $y$ is being handled in the loop, so for example in $xyyz$, the both $y$ get handled by the loop "read $y$".

\section{Proof:}
\begin{proof}
Let $D=(Q,\Sigma, \delta, q_0,F)$ be a DFA accepting $L$ and $p$ be the number of states of $D$
Let $w=w_1w_2\cdots w_n\in L$ and  $\mid w\mid =n$ and $n\ge p$.
Let the sequence of states $w$ go through be $r_1,r_2\cdots r_{n+1}$
$$r_{i+1}=\delta(r_i,w_i)\forall i\in [1,n]$$
According to pigeonhole principle($p+1$ pigeons and $p$ pigeonholes) , the first $p+1$ states must have a repetition of a state, let the first occurrence of the state $r_a$ and the occurrence be $r_b$ and also $b\le p+1$. 

Now let $$x=w_1\cdots w_{a-1}$$ $$y=w_a\cdots w_{b-1}$$ $$z=w_b\cdots w_n$$
For $i\ge0$, $w'=xy^iz$ , $x$ takes $D$ from $r_1$ to $r_a$, $y$ takes $D$ from $r_a$ to $r_a$ and $z$ takes $D$ from $r_a$ to $r_n+1$, hence $D$ must accept $w'$ . Furthermore,
$$a\ne b\implies \mid y\mid>0$$
$$b\le p+1\implies b-1\le p \implies \mid xy\mid \le p$$
\end{proof}

\section{Application:}
Pumping lemma can be used to prove that a language is not regular by "Proof by Contradiction". We assume that the language is regular and choose a string whose length is greater than the pumping constant and that can't be pumped and we reach a contradiction by failing to divide the string into any $x,y,z$ and then put forward that the language is not regular.

It is important to note that the converse of pumping lemma is not true i.e. a language that satisfies these conditions is not necessarily a regular language.

\subsection{Example 1}

Prove that the language $L=\{0^n1^n\mid n\in \mathbb{N}\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=0^p1^p$$ $$\mid w\mid=2p>p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=0^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=0^k$ and $x=0^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=0^{p-q}1^p$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma, 
$$(\forall n\ge0)(xy^nz)\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{q-k}0^{kn}0^{p-q}1^p\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{k(n-1)+p}1^p\in L$$
Since $k\in[1,p]$, $k(n-1)+p\ne p$ hence $0^{k(n-1)+p}1^p\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example 2}

Prove that the language $L=\{ss\mid s\in \{ 0,1\}^*\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=0^p10^p1$$ $$\mid w\mid=2p+2>p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=0^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=0^k$ and $x=0^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=0^{p-q}10^p1$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma, 
$$(\forall n\ge0)(xy^nz)\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{q-k}0^{kn}0^{p-q}10^p1\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{k(n-1)+p}10^p1\in L$$
Since $k\in[1,p]$, $k(n-1)+p\ne p$ hence $0^{k(n-1)+p}1^p\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example 3}

Prove that the language $L=\{1^{n^2}\mid n\ge 0\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=1^{p^2}$$ $$\mid w\mid=p^2>p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=1^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=1^k$ and $x=1^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=1^{p^2-q}$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma, for $n=2$
$$(xy^2z)\in L$$
$$\implies 1^{q-k}1^{2k}1^{p^2-q}\in L$$
$$\implies 1^{p^2+k}\in L$$
$p^2+k$ must be a perfect square. $1\le k\le q$ and $q\le p$ implies $1\le k\le p$ 
$$(1\le k\le q)\wedge (q\le p)\implies 1\le k\le p$$
The next perfect square after $p^2$ is $(p+1)^2$,so there are no perfect square in $(p^2,(p+1)^2)$, Also, $(p+1)^2-p^2=2p+1$, But
$$k\le p$$
$$k< 2p$$
$$k< 2p+1$$
So, $1^{p^2+k}\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example 4}

Prove that the language $L=\{0^i1^j\mid i>j\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=0^p1^{p-1}$$ $$\mid w\mid=2p-1\ge p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=0^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=0^k$ and $x=0^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=0^{p-q}1^{p-1}$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma, for $n=0$
$$(xy^0z)\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{q-k}0^{0}0^{p-q}1^{p-1}\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{p-k}1^{p-1}\in L$$
Since $k\in[1,p]$, $p-k\le p-1$ hence $0^{p-k}1^{p-1}\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example 5}

Prove that the language $L=\{0^n1^n2^n\mid n\ge0\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=0^p1^p2^p$$ $$\mid w\mid=3p>p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=0^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=0^k$ and $x=0^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=0^{p-q}1^p2^p$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma,
$$(\forall n\ge0)(xy^nz)\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{q-k}0^{kn}0^{p-q}1^p2^p\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{k(n-1)+p}1^p2^p\in L$$
Since $k\in[1,p]$, $k(n-1)+p\ne p$ hence $0^{k(n-1)+p}1^p2^p\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example 6}

Prove that the language $L=\{sss\mid s\in \{ 0,1\}^*\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=0^p10^p10^p1$$ $$\mid w\mid=3p+3>p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=0^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=0^k$ and $x=0^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=0^{p-q}1^p0^p1$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma, 
$$(\forall n\ge0)(xy^nz)\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{q-k}0^{kn}0^{p-q}10^p10^p1\in L$$
$$\implies 0^{k(n-1)+p}10^p10^p1\in L$$
Since $k\in[1,p]$, $k(n-1)+p\ne p$ hence $0^{k(n-1)+p}10^p10^p1\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Example 7}

Prove that the language $L=\{1^{2^n}\mid n\ge 0\}$ is not regular.

\begin{proof}
Let us assume $L$ to be a regular language. Now according to pumping lemma $\exists(p\ge1)$.
Let the string $w\in L$ and $$w=1^{2^p}$$ $$\mid w\mid=2^p>p $$ $$w=xyz$$
As $\mid xy\mid\le p$, $xy=1^q$ where $q=\mid xy\mid\le p$. Let $y=1^k$ and $x=1^{q-k}$ where $k\in[1,q]$ and $z=1^{2^p-q}$.
Now by statement 3 of lemma, for $n=2$
$$(xy^2z)\in L$$
$$\implies 1^{q-k}1^{2k}1^{2^p-q}\in L$$
$$\implies 1^{2^p+k}\in L$$                            

$2^p+k$ must be a power of 2. But, as $k\in[1,p]$

$$2^p>k$$
$$2^p+2^p>k+2^p$$
$$2^{p+1}>2^p+k$$
And no power of 2 lies in $(2^p,2^{p+1})$. So, $1^{2^p+k}\notin L$. A contradiction!

Hence, the initial assumption was wrong and the language $L$ is not regular.
